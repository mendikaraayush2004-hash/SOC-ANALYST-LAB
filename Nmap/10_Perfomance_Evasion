to speed up scans and bypass firewalls and hide scanning hosts we can use this methods

TIMING TEMPLATE -T1 to -T5
-T0  : (paranoid) IDS evasion and long time wait
-T1  : (sneaky) IDS evasion and long time wait
-T2  : (polite)slows scan to consume less bandwidth
-T3  : (normal)default scan
-T4  : (aggressive) fast and only use on reliable networks
-T5  : (insane) only very fast , this can overhelm the target

FRAGMENTATION 
when you use 
  -f
TCP header is coverted into tiny packets 
but modern devices have the solution for this

DECOYS 
 option : -D 
this is used like smoke and mirror
working : multiple IP shows on target hidning the real one

nmap -D <decoy IP>,<decoy IP>,<decoy IP>, ME <Main target>
