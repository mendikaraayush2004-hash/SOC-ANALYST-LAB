CHANGING PERMISSIONS OF A FILE 

We use chmod to change the permissions of a file 
    	chmod 764 file.type 

In here first number is for user 
second number is for group
third number is for others
this type is called binary permission system 
in which
4 = read
2 = write
1 = execute

CHANGING OWNERSHIP
to change ownership we use chown


	   chow username:groupname file,type
